Authentication - The process of validating that an entity (user, application, or system) is who or what they claim to be
Authorization - The process of granting an authenticated entity permission to access a resource or perform aspecific function
Accounting - Is generally implemented for two use cases:
 - Monitoring, visibility, and reporting
 - Billing, chargeback, and reporting
Authoriziation Models: ABDAC
- Attribute-based dynamic access control (ABDAC) combines the princples of attribute-based access control (ABAC) with dynamic access control (DAC)
It considers dynamic factors such as risk assessment, user attributes, resources attributes, and contextual information to make access control decisicons in real time

Authorization Models: Rule-based
- rule-based access control (RBAC): RBAC users rules to determine access
- access control rules define conditions.

SECURITY CONTROL TYPES
- PREVENTATIVE Stops an attacker form successfully conductiing an exploit or adcanced persistent threat
- DETERRENT Discourages an attacker from initiating or continuing an attack
- DETECTIVE Identifies an attack that is occurring as well as the steps of the kill chain
- CORRECTIVE Restores a system to state before the negative event occured; can simplu rectify or correct an identified problem
- COMPENSATING Aids controls that are already in place provides a tempoaray stopgap solution
- DIRECTIVE Mandatory policies and regulations taht are in place to maintain consistency and compliance
